# Passerby Diary

This is the final project for INFO 6250 course.

## Description
Passerby Diary is a simple and sophisticated diary application. The passerby Diary also has a ‘passerby’ section. Diaries post to the 'passerby' section are open to all users. But passers-by can only view your passerby diary, and they can't comment or connect with you. Because we are all travelers after all.
